## My process

### What I learned
- Adding the hover effect on the image (background + icon triggering on hover).
- Animating css with `transition`.
- Styling `<hr>` elements. 


### Questions to community
Hi everyone, 

I am pretty satisfied with the outcome, but unsure whether I have used proper or common approches on these three subjects :
- Styling `<hr>` elements : the problem being that mine without the `opacity: 30%` seems too wide (in comparison to the design expectations) even after reducing its height to the minimum of 1px. So I am wondering is there exists some sort of a css one liner that would render a thin line (thinner than 1px ?) without having to use all those `border` and `opacity` properties. 
- Adding the hover effect on the image (background + icon triggering on hover).
- The circle around the avatar.

Any feedback on those or any other part of the challenge is welcome !

Thank you all.
